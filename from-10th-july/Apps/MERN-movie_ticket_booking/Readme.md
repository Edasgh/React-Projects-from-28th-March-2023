# Online Movie Ticket Booking Project

## Project Title: Online Movie Ticket Booking

## Project Description

The Online Movie Ticket Booking System allows users to order tickets for a show.
gather information about movies and venues. To purchase show tickets, the
customer must first register at the location. When selecting a show, the user is
presented with a seating configuration from which he can select seats. He'll be
redirected to the payment input screen to create a group activity from there. The
suggested application allows users to reserve a movie from a theatre for a specific
time and location. The user can display their booking history as a theatre ticket saving time and money.
