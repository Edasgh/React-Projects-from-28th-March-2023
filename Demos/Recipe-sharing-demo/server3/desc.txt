Run the application:
Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running.
Open two terminal windows, one for the backend and one for the frontend.
In the backend terminal, navigate to the backend folder and run node server.js to start the backend server.
In the frontend terminal, navigate to the frontend folder and run npm start to start the React development server.
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see the recipe-sharing app in action.
This is a basic implementation to get you started. You can further enhance the app by adding user authentication, the ability to save recipes, search functionality, and more.
